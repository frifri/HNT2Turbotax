# HNT2Turbotax

Convert your HNT earning CSV to a Turbotax friendly format

This project currently uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage it's packages.

The raw CSV that I used was generated using the following tool: https://www.fairspot.host/hnt-export-mining-tax.
The current script does not support all transaction type and may be very limited.
